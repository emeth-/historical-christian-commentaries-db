{"quote":"Our Lord delayed His coming for four days, that the resurrection of Lazarus might be the more glorious: Then when Jesus came, He found that He had lain in the grave four days already.\n\nThe first sin was elation of heart, the second assent, the third act, the fourth habit.\nNow Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.\n\nI am the resurrection, because I am the life; as through Me he will rise at the general resurrection, through Me he may rise now.\n\nBecause He hath attained to the life of the Spirit, and to an immortal resurrection. Our Lord, from Whom nothing was hid, knew that she believed, but sought from her a confession unto salvation: Believest thou this? She saith unto Him, Yea, Lord, I believe that Thou art the Christ the Son of God, which should come into the world.","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas"}]}
