    "quote": "(Metaphrastes sup.) But what John's work is to be, and what he will do through the Holy Spirit, is shewn as follows; And many of the children of Israel shall he turn, &c.\n\nOr else; The Jews were the parents of John and the Apostles; but, nevertheless, from pride and infidelity raged violently against the Gospel. Therefore, like dutiful children, John first, and the Apostles after him, declared to them the truth, winning them over to their own righteousness and wisdom. So also will Elias convert the remnant of Hebrews to the truth of the Apostles.",
