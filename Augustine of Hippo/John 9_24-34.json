He says this in indignation at the obstinacy of the Jews; not tolerating blindness, now that he is no longer blind himself.\n\n(Tr. xliv. 12) A malediction only in the intention of the speakers, not in the words themselves. May such a malediction (\u1f10\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03b4\u03cc\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd, maledixerunt, Vulg.) be upon us, and upon our children! It follows: But we are Moses' disciples.
