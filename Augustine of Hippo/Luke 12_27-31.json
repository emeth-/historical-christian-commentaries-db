But in speaking concerning increasing the stature of the body, He refers to that which is least, that is, to God, to make bodies.\n\n(de Qu Ev. l. ii. qu. 29.) Now having forbidden all thought about food, he next goes on to warn men not to be puffed up, saying, Neither be ye lifted up, (nolite in sublime tolli \u03bc\u1f74 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u03b5.) for man first seeks these things to satisfy his wants, but when he is filled, he begins to be puffed up concerning them. This is just as if a wounded man should boast that he had many plasters in his house, whereas it were well for him that he had no wounds, and needed not even one plaster.",
