    "quote": "(cont. Faust. xviii. 7.) The tares the Lord expounds to mean, not as Manich\u00e6us interprets, certain spurious parts inserted among the true Scriptures, but all the children of the Evil one, that is, the imitators of the fraud of the Devil. As it follows, The tares are the children of the evil one, by whom He would have us understand all the wicked and impious.\n\n(Qu\u00e6st. Ev. i. 10.) For all weeds among corn are called tares. It follows, The enemy who sowed this is the Devil.\n\n(De Civ. Dei. xx. 9.) Out of that kingdom in which are no offences? The kingdom then is His kingdom which is here, namely, the Church.\n\n(Qu\u00e6st. Ev. i. 10.) That the tares are first separated, signifies that by tribulation the wicked shall be separated from the righteous; and this is understood to be performed by good Angels, because the good can discharge duties of punishment with a good spirit, as a judge, or as the Law, but the wicked cannot fulfil offices of mercy.",
