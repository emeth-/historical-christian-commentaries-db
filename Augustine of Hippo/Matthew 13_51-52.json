    "quote": "(De Civ. Dei, xx. 4.) He said not 'old and new,' as He surely would have said had He not preferred to preserve the order of value rather than of time. But the Manich\u00e6ans while they think they should keep only the new promises of God, remain in the old man of the flesh, and put on newness of error.\n\n(Qu\u00e6st. in Matt. q. 16.) By this conclusion, whether did He desire to shew whom He intended by the treasure hid in the field\u2014in which case we might understand the Holy Scriptures to be here meant, the two Testaments by the things new and old\u2014or did He intend that he should be held learned in the Church who understood that the Old Scriptures were expounded in parables, taking rules from these new Scriptures, seeing that in them also the Lord proclaimed many things in parables. If He then, in whom all those old Scriptures have their fulfilment and manifestation, yet speaks in parables until His passion shall rend the vail, when there is nothing hid that shall not be revealed; much more those things which were written of Him so long time before we see to have been clothed in parables; which the Jews took literally, being unwilling to be learned in the kingdom of heaven.",
