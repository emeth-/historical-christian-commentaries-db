{"quote":"(Qu\u00e6st. Ev. ii. in fin.) That they took from off the Lord in His passion His own garment, and put on Him a coloured robe, denotes those heretics who said that He had a shadowy, and not a real body.\n\nThis is to be understood to have been done at the end of all, when He was led off to crucifixion after Pilate had delivered Him up to the Jews.\n\n(de Cons. Ev. iii. 11.) And they gave him to drink wine mingled with gall. Mark says, mingled with myrrh. Matthew put gall (Mark 15:23.) to express bitterness, but wine mingled with myrrh is very bitter; though indeed it might be, that gall together with myrrh would make the most bitter.\n\n(ubi sup.) And when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink. That Mark says, But he received it not, we understand to mean that He would not receive it to drink thereof. For that He tasted it Matthew bears witness; so that Matthew's, He could not drink thereof, means exactly the same as Mark's, He received it not; only Mark does not mention His tasting it.\nThat He tasted but would not drink of it, signifies that He tasted the bitterness of death for us, but rose again the third day.","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [ECATH]"},{"url":"https:\/\/ccel.org\/ccel\/aquinas\/catena1\/catena1.i.html","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [CCEL]"}]}
