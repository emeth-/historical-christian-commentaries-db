    "quote": "The connexion of this passage admits of much taking place in the interval previously. Jud\u00e6a and Galilee are divisions of the province of Palestine. Jud\u00e6a has its name from the tribe of Judah; but it embraces not only the territories of Judah, but of Benjamin, all of which were called Jud\u00e6a, because Judah was the royal tribe. Galilee has its name, from the milky, i. e. white, colour of its inhabitants; Galilee being Greek for milk.\n\nMeaning to say, Thou doest miracles, and only a few see them: go to the royal city, where the rulers are, that they may see Thy miracles, and so Thou obtain praise. And as our Lord had not brought all His disciples with Him, but left many behind in Jud\u00e6a, they add, That Thy disciples also may see the works that Thou doest.\n\nThis is no contradiction to what the Apostle says, But when the fulness of time was come, God sent forth His Son. (Gal. 4:4) Our Lord referring here to the time not of His nativity, but of His glorification.",
