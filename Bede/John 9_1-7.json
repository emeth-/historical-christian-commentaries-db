The passage or journey here is His descent from heaven to earth, where He saw the blind man, i. e. looked with compassion on the human race.\n\nFor when the Son declared that He worked the works of the Father, He proved that His and His Father's works were the same: which are to heal the sick, to strengthen the weak, and enlighten man.",
