    "quote": "A certain ruler having heard our Lord say, that only those who would be like little children should enter the kingdom of heaven, entreats Him to explain to him not by parable but openly by what works he may merit to obtain eternal life.\n\nOr we must not think him to have lied, but to have avowed that he had lived honestly, that is, at least in outward things, else Mark could never have said, And Jesus seeing him, loved him. (Mark. 10:21.)\n\nWhoever then wishes to be perfect must sell all that he hath, not a part only, as Ananias and Sapphira did, but the whole.",
