    "quote": "Hitherto our Lord had been speaking of those things which were to come to pass for forty years, the end not yet coming. He now describes the very end itself of the desolation, which was accomplished by the Roman army; as it is said, And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed, &c.\n\n(Ecc. Hist. lib. iii. c. 5.) The ecclesiastical history relates, that all the Christians who were in Jud\u00e6a, when the destruction of Jerusalem was approaching, being warned of the Lord, departed from that place, and dwelt beyond the Jordan in a city called Pella, until the desolation of Jud\u00e6a was ended.\n\nBut how, while the city was already compassed with an army, were they to depart out? except that the preceding word \"then\" is to be referred, not to the actual time of the siege, but the period just before, when first the armed soldiers began to disperse themselves through the parts of Galilee and Samaria.\n\nAnd these are the days of vengeance, that is, the days exacting vengeance for our Lord's blood.\n\nHe says then, Woe to them that nurse, or give suck, as some interpret it, whose womb or arms now heavy with the burden of children, cause no slight obstacle to the speed of flight.\n\nWhich indeed the Apostle makes mention of when he says, Blindness in part is happened to Israel, and so all Israel shall be saved. (Rom. 11:25.) Which when it shall have gained the promised salvation, hopes not rashly to return to the land of its fathers.",
