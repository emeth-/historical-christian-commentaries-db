    "quote": "The devil saying to our Saviour, If thou wilt fall down and worship me, receives answer that he himself ought rather to worship Christ as his Lord and God.\n\nBut some one may ask how this injunction agrees with the word of the Apostle, which says, Beloved, serve one another. (Gal. 5:13.) In the Greek, \u03b4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 signifies a common service, (i. e. given either to God or man,) according to which we are bid to serve one another; but \u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 is the service due to the worship of the Deity, with which we are bid to serve God alone.",
