{"quote":"But some one may ask how this injunction agrees with the word of the Apostle, which says, Beloved, serve one another. (Gal. 5:13.) In the Greek, \u03b4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 signifies a common service, (i. e. given either to God or man,) according to which we are bid to serve one another; but \u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 is the service due to the worship of the Deity, with which we are bid to serve God alone.","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas"}]}
