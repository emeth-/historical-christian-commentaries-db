{"quote":"(in Marc. 2, 35) Philip was that brother of Herod, of whom we spoke above, who in honour of Tiberius C\u00e6sar called that town, which is now called Paneas, C\u00e6sarea Philippi. It goes on, And by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?\n\n(ubi sup.) Wherefore He first asks what is the opinion of men, in order to try the faith of the disciples, lest their confession should appear to be founded on the common opinion. It goes on, And they answered, saying, Some say John the Baptist, some Elias, and others, One of the prophets.\n\n(ubi sup. Chrys. ubi sup.) This, however, he speaks with the feelings of a man who loves and desires; as if he said, This cannot be, neither can mine ears receive that the Son of God is to be slain.","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas"},{"url":"https:\/\/ccel.org\/ccel\/aquinas\/catena2\/catena2.i.html","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas"}]}
