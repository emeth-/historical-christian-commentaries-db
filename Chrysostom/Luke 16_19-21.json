{"quote":"There was, not is, because he had passed away as a fleeting shadow.\n\n(ut sup.) Ashes, dust, and earth he covered with purple, and silk; or ashes, dust, and earth bore upon them purple and silk. As his garments were, so was also his food. Therefore with us also as our food is, such let our clothing be Hence it follows, And he fared sumptuously every day.\n\n(ut sup.) But a parable is that in which an example is given, while the names are omitted. Lazarus is interpreted, \"one who was assisted.\" For he was poor, and the Lord helped him.","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [ECATH]"}]}
