{"quote":"Having concluded the second answer, He brings forward yet a third, saying, Or how can any enter into a strong man's house? For that Satan cannot cast out Satan is clear from what has been said; and that no other can cast him out, till he have first overcome him, is plain to all. Thus the same as before is established yet more abundantly; for He says, So far am I from having the Devil for my ally, that I rather am at war with him, and bind him; and in that I cast out after this sort, I therein spoil his goods. Thus He proves the very contrary of that they strove to establish. They would shew that He did not cast out d\u00e6mons of His own power; He proves that not only d\u00e6mons, yea but the prince also of the d\u00e6mons He hath bound, as is shewn by that which He hath wrought. For if their Prince were not overcome, how were the d\u00e6mons who are His subjects thus spoiled. This speech seems also to me to be a prophecy; inasmuch as He not only casts out d\u00e6mons, but will take away all error out of the world, and dissolve the craft of the Devil; and He says not rob, but spoil, shewing that He will do it with power.\n\nHe calls him strong, shewing therein his old reign, which arose out of our sloth.","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [ECATH]"},{"url":"https:\/\/ccel.org\/ccel\/aquinas\/catena1\/catena1.i.html","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [CCEL]"}]}
