{"quote":"(Hom. lxviii.) The design of this further parable is to shew that their guilt was heinous, and unworthy to be forgiven.\n\nOr, it applies to His long-suffering, in that He did not always bring down immediate punishment on their sins.\n\n(non occ. ap. Chrys.) He calls the Prophets servants, who as the Lord's Priests offer the fruits of the people, and the proofs of their obedience in their works. But they shewed their wickedness not only in refusing the fruits, but in having indignation against those that come to them, as it follows, And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.\n\nWherefore then did He not send Him immediately? That from what they had done to the others they might accuse themselves, and putting away their madness they might reverence His Son when He came.\n\nOr He speaks as declaring what ought to be; they ought to reverence Him; thus shewing that their sin was great, and void of all excuse.\n\nOr there is no contradiction, because both are right; they first made answer in these words, and then the Lord repeated them.\n\nOr otherwise: the Lord proposed this parable to them with this intent, that not understanding it they should give sentence against themselves; as was done by Nathan to David. Again, when they perceived the meaning of the things that had been said against them, they said, God forbid.\n\nChrist is the stone, the builders are the Jewish teachers who rejected Christ, saying, This man is not of God. (John 9:16.)\n\nAnd that they might know that nothing that had been done was against God's will, He adds, It is the Lord's doing.\n\nOr, He here points out their twofold destruction; first in their stumbling and being offended at Him, signified in that, Whosoever shall fall upon this stone; the other in the captivity that should come upon them, signified by that, But upon whomsoever it shall fall.","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [ECATH]"},{"url":"https:\/\/ccel.org\/ccel\/aquinas\/catena1\/catena1.i.html","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [CCEL]"}]}
