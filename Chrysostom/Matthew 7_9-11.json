{"quote":"There are two things behoveful for one that prays; that he ask earnestly; and that he ask such things as he ought to ask. And those are spiritual things; as Solomon, because he asked such things as were right, received speedily.\n\nThis He said not detracting from human nature, nor confessing the whole human race to be evil; but He calls paternal love evil when compared with His own goodness. Such is the superabundance of His love towards men.","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [ECATH]"},{"url":"https:\/\/ccel.org\/ccel\/aquinas\/catena1\/catena1.i.html","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [CCEL]"}]}
