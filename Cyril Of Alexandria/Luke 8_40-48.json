{"quote":"(v. Chrys. 31. in Matt.) This was the greatest sign that He had really put on our flesh, and trampled under foot all pride. For they followed Him not afar off, but thronged Him.\n\nFor it was not lawful for the unclean either to touch any of the holy saints, or come near a holy man.\n\nFor the miracle which was performed escaped not the Lord, but He who knew all things asks as if He were ignorant.\n\nMoreover, He persuaded the ruler of the synagogue to believe undoubtingly that He would rescue his daughter from the hands of death.","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [ECATH]"}]}
