    "quote": "The Saviour next manifests His glory by drawing over Israel to the faith. As it follows, And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, men who were banished from the towns and cities, and counted unclean, according to the rites of the Mosaic law.\n\nThe law also ordered, that those who were cleansed from leprosy should offer sacrifice for the sake of their purification.\n\nWhereby the Jewish priests who were jealous of His glory might know that it was by Christ granting them health that they were suddenly and miraculously healed.",
