{"quote":"(ubi sup.) But Christ was the mystery which has been revealed in the last times of the world, having been prepared before the foundation of the world. Hence it follows, which thou hast prepared before the face of all men.\n\n(ubi sup.) But Christ coming was made a light to them that sat in darkness, being sore oppressed by the power of the devil, but they were called by God the Father to the knowledge of His Son, Who is the true light.","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas"}]}
