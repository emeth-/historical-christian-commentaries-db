{"quote":"(ord.) He holds them therefore in this dilemma. For Christ casts out d\u00e6mons either by the power of God, or by the Prince of the d\u00e6mons. If by the power of God, their accusations are malicious; if by the Prince of the d\u00e6mons, his kingdom is divided, and will not stand, and therefore let them depart out of his kingdom. And this alternative He intimates that they had chosen for themselves, when they refused to believe in Him.","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [ECATH]"},{"url":"https:\/\/ccel.org\/ccel\/aquinas\/catena1\/catena1.i.html","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [CCEL]"}]}
