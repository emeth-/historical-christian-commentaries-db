{"quote":"(non occ.) The disciples were exceeding sorrowful when they heard of the Lord's passion, and therefore that none might ascribe His suffering to compulsion, and not to a voluntary Submission, he adds an incident which instances Christ's power, and is submission; And when they were come to Capernaum, there came to Peter those who received the didrachma, and said unto him, Doth not your Master pay the didrachma?\n\n(ap. Anselm.) Otherwise; Peter answered, Yea; meaning, yea, He does not pay. And Peter sought to acquaint the Lord that the Herodians had demanded tribute, but the Lord prevented him; as it follows, And when he had entered into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, Of whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or tribute, (i. e. head-money,) of their children, or of strangers?\n\n(non occ.) Or because Jesus had not any image of C\u00e6sar, (for the prince of this world had nothing in Him,) therefore He furnished an image of C\u00e6sar, not out of their own stock, but out of the sea. But He takes not the stater into His own possession, that there should never be found an image of C\u00e6sar upon the Image of the invisible God.\n\n(ap. Anselm.) For by custom every several man paid a didrachma for himself; now a stater is equal to two didrachmas.","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [ECATH]"},{"url":"https:\/\/ccel.org\/ccel\/aquinas\/catena1\/catena1.i.html","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [CCEL]"}]}
