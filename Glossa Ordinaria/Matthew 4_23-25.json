    "quote": "(ap. Anselm.) Because preachers should have good testimony from those who are without, lest if their life is open to censure, their preaching be contemned, he adds, And the fame of him went abroad through all Syria.\n\n'Sickness' means a lasting ailment; 'torment' is an acute pain, as pleurisy, and such like; they who had d\u00e6mons are they who were tormented by the d\u00e6mons.\n\n(ap. Anselm.) The crowds that follow the Lord, are they of the Church, which is spiritually designated by Galilee, passing to virtuousness; Decapolis is he who keeps the Ten Commandments; Jerusalem and Jud\u00e6a, he who is enlightened by the vision of peace and confession; and beyond Jordan, he who having passed the waters of Baptism enters the land of promise.",
