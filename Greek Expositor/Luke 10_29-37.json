{"quote":"(Severus) He has well used the general term. For He says not, \"a certain one went down,\" but, a certain man, for his discourse was of the whole human race.\n\n(Severus.) Now Christ here fully calls Himself a Samaritan. For in addressing the lawyer who was glorying in the Law, He wished to express that neither Priest nor Levite, nor all they who were conversant with the Law, fulfilled the requirements of the Law, but He came to accomplish the ordinances of the Law.\n\nOr He came by the way. For He was a true traveller, not a wanderer; and came down to the earth for our sakes.","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas"}]}
