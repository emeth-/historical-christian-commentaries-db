    "quote": "(Mor. xix. 1.) Otherwise; The fox is a crafty animal, lying hid in ditches and dens, and when it comes abroad never going in a straight path, but in crooked windings; birds raise themselves in the air. By the foxes then are meant the subtle and deceitful d\u00e6mons, by the birds the proud d\u00e6mons; as though He had said; Deceitful and proud d\u00e6mons have their abode in your heart; but my lowliness finds no rest in a proud spirit.\n\n(Mor. iv. 27.) The dead also bury the dead, when sinners protect sinners. They who exalt sinners with their praises, hide the dead under a pile of words.",
