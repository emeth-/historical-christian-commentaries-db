{"quote":"Nicodemus cannot take in the mysteries of the Divine Majesty, which our Lord reveals, and therefore asks how it is, not denying the fact, not meaning any censure, but wishing to be informed: Nicodemus answered and said unto Him, How can these things be?\n\n(Hom. in Oct. Pent.) Why, it is asked, does He speak in the plural number, We speak that we do know?
