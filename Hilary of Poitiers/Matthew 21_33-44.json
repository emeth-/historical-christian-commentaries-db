    "quote": "Or, He set forth the Prophets as it were winepresses, into which an abundant measure of the Holy Spirit, as of new wine, might flow in a teeming stream.\n\nOr, The tower is the eminence of the Law, which ascended from earth to heaven, and from which, as from a watch-tower, the coming of Christ might be spied. And let it out to husbandmen.\n\nThese more than the first who were sent, denote that time, when, after the preaching of single Prophets, a great number was sent forth together.\n\nBy the Son sent at last, is denoted the advent of our Lord.\n\nChrist was cast out of Jerusalem, as out of the vineyard, to His sentence of punishment.\n\nHe is become the head of the corner, because He is the union of both sides between the Law and the Gentiles.",
