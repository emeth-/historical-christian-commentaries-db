    "quote": "For if there remain with us nothing that is C\u00e6sar's, we shall not be bound by the condition of rendering to him the things that are his; but if we lean upon what is his, if we avail ourselves of the lawful protection of his power, we cannot complain of it as any wrong if we are required to render to C\u00e6sar the things of C\u00e6sar.\n\nIt behoves us also to render unto God the things that are His, namely, body, soul, and will. For C\u00e6sar's coin is in the gold, in which His image was pourtrayed, that is, God's coin, on which the Divine image is stamped; give therefore your money to C\u00e6sar, but preserve a conscience void of offence for God.",
