{"quote":"If these little creations fall not without God's superintendence and providence, and if things made to perish, perish not without God's will, you who are immortal ought not to fear that you live without His providence.\n\nThat He says, The hairs of your head are all numbered, shews the boundless providence of God towards man, and a care unspeakable that nothing of ours is hid from God.\n\nThose who deny the resurrection of the flesh ridicule the sense of the Church on this place, as if we affirmed that every hair that has ever been cut off by the razor rises again, when the Saviour says, Every hair of your head\u2014not is saved, but\u2014is numbered. Where there is number, knowledge of that number is implied, but not preservation of the same hairs.\n\nThis expresses still more clearly the sense as it was above explained, that they should not fear those who can kill the body, for if the least animal falls not without God's knowledge, how much less a man who is dignified with the Apostolic rank?","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [ECATH]"},{"url":"https:\/\/ccel.org\/ccel\/aquinas\/catena1\/catena1.i.html","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [CCEL]"}]}
