{"quote":"The Pharisees ascribed the works of God to the Prince of the d\u00e6mons; and the Lord makes answer not to what they said, but to what they thought, that even thus they might be compelled to believe His power, Who saw the secrets of the heart; Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said unto them.\n\nFor as small things grow by concord, so the greatest fall to pieces through dissensions.\n\nAs much as to say, If Satan fight against himself, and d\u00e6mon be an enemy to d\u00e6mon, then must the end of the world be at hand, that these hostile powers should have no place there, whose mutual war is peace for men.\n\nBut if ye think, ye Scribes and Pharisees, that the d\u00e6mons depart out of the possessed in obedience to their Prince, that men may be imposed upon by a concerted fraud, what can ye say to the healing of diseases which the Lord also wrought? It is something more if ye assign to the d\u00e6mons even bodily infirmities, and the signs of spiritual virtues.","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [ECATH]"},{"url":"https:\/\/ccel.org\/ccel\/aquinas\/catena1\/catena1.i.html","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [CCEL]"}]}
