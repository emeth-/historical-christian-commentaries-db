    "quote": "The 'satum' is a kind of measure in use in Palestine containing one modius and a half.\n\nOr otherwise; The woman who takes the leaven and hides it, seems to me to be the Apostolic preaching, or the Church gathered out of divers nations. She takes the leaven, that is, the understanding of the Scriptures, and hides it in three measures of meal, that the three, spirit, soul, and body, may be brought into one, and may not differ among themselves. Or otherwise; We read in Plato that there are three parts in the soul, reason, anger, and desire; (R. P. iv. 439. \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c7\u1f78\u03bd, \u1f10\u03c7\u03b9\u03b4\u03bd\u03bc\u03c0\u03c4\u03b9\u03c7\u1f78\u03c5, \u03b8\u03bd\u03bc\u03bf\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u1f72\u03c2) so we also if we have received the evangelic leaven of Holy Scripture, may possess in our reason prudence, in our anger hatred against vice, in our desire love of the virtues, and this will all come to pass by the Evangelic teaching which our mother Church has held out to us. I will further mention an interpretation of some; that the woman is the Church, who has mingled the faith of man in three measures of meal, namely, belief in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit; which when it has fermented into one lump, brings us not to a threefold God, but to the knowledge of one Divinity. This is a pious interpretation; but parables and doubtful solutions of dark things, can never bestow authority on dogmas.",
