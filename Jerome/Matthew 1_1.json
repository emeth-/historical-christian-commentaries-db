{"quote":"(Prolog. in Comm. in Matt.) 'The face of a man' (in Ezekiel's vision [Ez. 1:5]) signifies Matthew, who accordingly opens his Gospel with the human genealogy of Christ.\n\n(Comm. in Matt. ch. 1.) We read in Isaiah, Who shall declare His generation? (Is. 53:8.) But it does not follow that the Evangelist contradicts the Prophet, or undertakes what he declares impossible; for Isaiah is speaking of the generation of the Divine nature; St. Matthew of the incarnation of the human.\n\nThe order of the names is inverted, but of necessity; for had he written Abraham first, and David afterwards, he would have to repeat Abraham again to preserve the series of the genealogy.","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [ECATH]"},{"url":"https:\/\/ccel.org\/ccel\/aquinas\/catena1\/catena1.i.html","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [CCEL]"}]}
