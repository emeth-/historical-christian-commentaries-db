    "quote": "Having declared that of that hour knoweth no man, but the Father only, He shews that it was not expedient for the Apostles to know, that being ignorant they might live in perpetual expectation of His coming, and thus concluding the whole, He says, Watch therefore, &c. And He does not say, 'Because we know not,' but Because ye know not, shewing that He Himself is not ignorant of the day of judgment.\n\nAnd by the instance of the master of the household, He teaches more plainly why He keeps secret the day of the consummation.",
