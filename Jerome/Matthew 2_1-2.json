    "quote": "We think the Evangelist first wrote, as we read in the Hebrew, 'Judah,' not 'Jud\u00e6a.' For in what other country is there a Bethlehem, that this needs to be distinguished as in 'Jud\u00e6a?' But 'Judah' is written, because there is another Bethlehem in Galilee.\n\nThey knew that such a star would rise by the prophecy of Balaam, whose successors they were. But whether they were Chald\u00e6ans, or Persians, or came from the utmost ends of the earth, how in so short a space of time could they arrive at Jerusalem?",
