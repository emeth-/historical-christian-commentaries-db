    "quote": "Also that by being Himself baptized, He might sanction the baptism of John.\n\nBeautifully said is that now, to shew that as Christ was baptized with water by John, so John must be baptized by Christ with the Spirit. Or, suffer now that I who have taken the form of a servant should fulfil all that low estate; otherwise know that in the day of judgment thou must be baptized with my baptism. Or, the Lord says, 'Suffer this now; I have also another baptism wherewithal I must be baptized; thou baptizest Me with water, that I may baptize thee for Me with thy own blood.'\n\nRighteousness; but he adds neither 'of the Law;' nor 'of nature,' that we may understand it of both.",
