I do not mean as some heretics hold, that the whole creation is animatec\u2014but by the power of the Maker things which to us have no consciousness have to Him.\n\nBut if any shall contend that it was the disciples who wondered, we shall answer they are rightly spoken of as 'the men,' seeing they had not yet learnt the power of the Saviour.","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [ECATH]"},{"url":"https:\/\/ccel.org\/ccel\/aquinas\/catena1\/catena1.i.html","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas [CCEL]"}]}
