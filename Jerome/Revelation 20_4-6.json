    "quote": "He [Papias] is said to have published a 'Second coming of Our Lord or Millennium'. Iren√¶us and Apollinaris and others who say that after the resurrection the Lord will reign in the flesh with the saints, follow him. Tertullian also in his work 'On the hope of the faithful', Victorinus of Petau and Lactantius follow this view.",
