    "quote": "Ver. 11. \"But you, O man of God.\"\n\nThis is a title of great dignity. For we are all men of God, but the righteous peculiarly so, not by right of creation only, but by that of appropriation.  If then you are a \"man of God,\" seek not superfluous things, which lead you not to God, but\n\n\"Flee these things, and follow after righteousness.\" Both expressions are emphatic; he does not say turn from one, and approach the other, but \"flee these things, pursue righteousness,\" so as not to be covetous.\n\n\"Godliness,\" that is, soundness in doctrines.\n\n\"Faith,\" which is opposed to questionings.\n\n\"Love,\" patience, meekness.",
