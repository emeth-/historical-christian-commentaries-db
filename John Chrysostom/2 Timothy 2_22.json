    "quote": "Ver. 22. \"Flee also youthful lusts.\"\n\nNot only the lust of fornication, but every inordinate desire is a youthful lust. Let the aged learn that they ought not to do the deeds of the youthful. If one be given to insolence, or a lover of power, of riches, of bodily pleasures, it is a youthful lust, and foolish. These things must proceed from a heart not yet established, from a mind not deeply grounded, but in a wavering state. What then does he advise in order that none may be captivated by these things? \"Flee youthful\" imaginations, but\n\n\"Follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.\"\n\nHe calls virtue in general, \"righteousness\": godliness of life, \"faith, meekness, charity.\"\n\nWhat is meant by \"those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart\"? It is as if he said, Rejoice not in those who only call upon the Lord; but those who call upon Him sincerely and unfeignedly, who have nothing of deceit about them, who approach Him in peace, who are not contentious. With these associate yourself. But with others be not easy, but only as far as lies in you, be peaceable.",
