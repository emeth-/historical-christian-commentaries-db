    "quote": "(Hom. 11. in Acta.) For an earthquake is at one time a sign of wrath, as when our Lord was crucified the earth shook; but at another time it is a token of God's providence, as when the Apostles were praying, the place was moved where they were assembled. It follows, and pestilence.\n\nBut He says, that the end of the city shall not come immediately, that is, the taking of Jerusalem, but there shall be many battles first.",
