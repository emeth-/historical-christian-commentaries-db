    "quote": "See how our Lord sets forth by his works the poverty which he taught. For him was no table spread, no lights, no house, nor any such thing.\n\n(Hom. 27. in Matt.) But what more necessary than the burial of his father, what more easy, seeing that there would not be much time given to it? We are then hereby taught that it becomes us not to spend even the slightest portion of our time in vain, although we have a thousand things to compel us, nay to prefer spiritual things to even our greatest necessities. For the devil watchfully presses close upon us, wishing to find any opening, and if he causes a slight negligence, he ends in producing a great weakness.\n\n(ubi sup.) By thus saying, their dead, he shews that this man's father was not his dead, for I suppose that the deceased was of the number of the unbelieving.",
