    "quote": "After that third reply, here follows a fourth, He that is not with me is against me.\n\nTherefore whoso gathereth not with me, nor is with me, may not be compared together with me, that with me he should cast out d\u00e6mons, but rather seeks to scatter what is mine. But tell me; If you were to have fought together with some one, and he should not be willing to come to your aid, is he not therefore against you? The Lord also Himself said in another place, He that is not against you is for you. (Luke 9:50) To which that which is here said is not contrary. For here He is speaking of the Devil who is our adversary\u2014there of some man who was on their side, of whom it is said, We saw one casting out d\u00e6mons in thy name. Here He seems to allude to the Jews, classing them with the Devil; for they were against Him, and scattered what He would gather. But it is fair to allow that He spoke this of Himself; for He was against the Devil, and scattered abroad the things of the Devil.",
