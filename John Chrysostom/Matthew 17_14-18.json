    "quote": "is to be noted, that were not man fortified here by Providence, he would long since have perished; for the d\u00e6mons who cast him into the fire, and into the water, would have killed him outright, had God not restrained him.\n\nSee herein also his folly, in that before the multitude he appeals to Jesus against His disciples. But He clears them from shame, inputing their failure to the patient himself; for many things shew that he was weak in faith. But He addresses His reproof not to the man singly, that He may not trouble him, but to the Jews in general. For many of those present, it is likely, had improper thoughts concerning the disciples, and therefore it follows, Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, how long shall I suffer you? His How long shall I be with you? shews that death was desired by Him, and that He longed for His withdrawal.\n\nWhen He had vindicated His disciples, He leads the boy's father to a cheering hope of believing that he shall be delivered out of this evil and that the father might be led to believe the miracle that was coming, seeing the d\u00e6mons was disturbed even when the child was only called;",
