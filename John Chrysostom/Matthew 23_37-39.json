    "quote": "For he who having seen many sinning yet remains uncorrected, but rather does the same or worse, is obnoxious to heavier punishment.\n\nThe Lord next turns to address the city, desiring to instruct His hearers thereby. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem: this repetition of the name is a mark of compassion and intense love.\n\nHaving thus addressed her, and spoken of her cruel murders, He said, as justifying Himself, How often would I have gathered thy children together? as much as to say, Notwithstanding, these thy murders have not alienated Me from thee, but I would have taken thee to Me, not once or twice, but many times. The strength of His affection He shews by the comparison of a hen.\n\nThen He threatens the punishment of which they were ever in fear, to wit, the overthrow of the city and temple, saying, Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.\n\nOtherwise; In this He covertly alludes to His second coming, when surely they shall worship Him. Henceforth, means from the time of His crucifixion.",
