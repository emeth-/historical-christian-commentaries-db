Nay more; it is something greater than commendation that the Evangelist signifies in the words, But Jesus hearing marvelled.\n\nWherefore He is said to have thus wondered in the presence of all the people, giving them an example that they also should wonder at Him; for it follows, And he said to them that followed, I have not found so great faith in Israel.\n\nFor it is a different thing for a Jew to believe and for a Gentile.\n\nOr, He calls them the children of the kingdom, because the kingdom was prepared for them, which was the greater grief to them.\n\nBut that none might suppose that these were nothing more than fair words, He makes them credible by the miracles following, And Jesus said to the centurion, Go, and be it done to thee as thou hast believed.\n\nWherein admire the speediness, shewing Christ's power, not only to heal, but to do it in a moment of time.",
