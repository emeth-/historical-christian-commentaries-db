{"quote":"This was not a mere natural defect; but was from the malignity of the d\u00e6mon; and therefore he needed to be brought of others, for he could not ask any thing of others as living without voice, and the d\u00e6mon chaining his spirit together with his tongue. Therefore Christ does not require faith of him, but immediately healed his disorder; as it follows, And when the d\u00e6mon was cast out, the dumb spake.\n\nThey set Him thus above others, because He not only healed, but with such ease, and quickness; and cured diseases both infinite in number, and in quality incurable. This most grieved the Pharisees, that they set Him before all others, not only those that then lived, but all who had lived before, on which account it follows, But the Pharisees said, He casteth out d\u00e6mons through the Prince of d\u00e6mons.\n\nWhat can be more foolish than this speech of theirs? For it cannot be pretended that one d\u00e6mon would cast out another; for they are wont to consent to one another's deeds, and not to be at variance among themselves. But Christ not only cast out d\u00e6mons, but healed the lepers, raised the dead, forgave sins, preached the kingdom of God, and brought men to the Father, which a d\u00e6mon neither could nor would do.","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas"},{"url":"https:\/\/ccel.org\/ccel\/aquinas\/catena1\/catena1.i.html","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas"}]}
