    "quote": "For the fashion of this world is grovelling and worthless, and but for a time, neither has ought of loftiness, or lastingness, or straightforwardness, but is wholly perverted. If then you would walk upright (or aright \u1f40 \u03c1\u03b8\u1f70]), figure not yourself after the fashion of this life present. For in it there is nought abiding or stable. And this is why he calls it a fashion (\u03c3\u03c7\u1f25\u03bc\u03b1); and so in another passage, \"the fashion of this world passes away.\" [1 Corinthians 7:31] For it has no durability or fixedness, but all in it is but for a season; and so he calls it this age (or world, Gr. \u03b1\u1f30& 241\u00b7\u03bd), hereby to indicate its liableness to misfortune, and by the word fashion its unsubstantialness. For speak of riches, or of glory, or beauty of person, or of luxury, or of whatever other of its seemingly great things you will, it is a fashion only, not reality, a show and a mask, not any abiding substance (\u1f51 \u03c0\u1f79\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2). But \"be not thou fashioned after this, but be transformed,\" he says, \"by the renewing of your mind.\" He says not change the fashion, but \"be transformed\" (\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03bf\u1f55), to show that the world's ways are a fashion, but virtue's not a fashion, but a kind of real form,  with a natural beauty of its own, lacking not the trickeries and fashions of outward things, which no sooner appear than they go to nought. For all these things, even before they come to light, are dissolving. If then you throw the fashion aside, you will speedily come to the form.  For nothing is more strengthless than vice, nothing so easily wears old. Then since it is likely that being men they would sin every day, he consoles his hearer by saying, \"renew yourself\" from day to day. This is what we do with houses, we keep constantly repairing them as they wear old, and so do thou unto yourself. Have you sinned today? Have you made your soul old? Despair not, despond not, but renew it by repentance, and tears [Hilary on Psalm 119], and confession, and by doing of good things. And never fail of doing this. And how are we to do this?\n\n\"That ye may prove (things more expedient (\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u1f73\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1]), and know ) what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.\"\n\nEither he means by this, be renewed, that you may learn what is more expedient for you, and what the will of God. Or rather, that you can get so renewed if you learn the things expedient, and what God may will. For if you see this, and know how to distinguish the nature of things, you are in possession of the whole way of virtue. And who, it may be said, is ignorant of what is expedient, and what is the will of God? They that are flurried with the things of this world, they that deem riches an enviable thing, they that make light of poverty, they that follow after power, they that are gaping after outward glory, they that think themselves great men when they raise fine houses, and buy costly sepulchres, and keep herds of slaves, and carry a great swarm of eunuchs about with them; these know not what is expedient for them, or what the will of God is. For both of these are but one thing. For God wills what things are expedient for us, and what God wills, that is also expedient for us. What then are the things which God wills? To live in poverty, in lowliness of mind, in contempt of glory; in continency, not in self-indulgence; in tribulation, not in ease; in sorrow, not in dissipation and laughter; in all the other points whereon He has given us laws. But the generality do even think these things of ill omen;  so far are they from thinking them expedient, and the will of God. This then is why they never can come near even to the labors for virtue's sake. For they that do not know so much even as what virtue may be, but reverence vice in its place, and take unto their bed the harlot instead of the modest wife, how are they to be able to stand aloof from the present world? Wherefore we ought above all to have a correct estimate of things, and even if we do not follow after virtue, to praise virtue, and even if we do not avoid vice, to stigmatize vice, that so far we may have our judgments uncorrupted. For so as we advance on our road, we shall be able to lay hold on the realities. This then is why he also bids you be renewed, \"that you may prove what is the will of God.\" But here he seems to me to be attacking the Jews too, who cling to the Law. For the old dispensation was a will of God, yet not the ultimate purpose, but allowed owing to their feebleness. But that which is a perfect one, and well-pleasing, is the new conversation. So too when he called it \"a reasonable service,\" it was to set it in contrast with that other (v. note p. 496) that he gave it such a name.",
