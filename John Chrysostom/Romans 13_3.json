    "quote": "For when he has given a deep wound, and stricken them down, he again uses gentler treatment, like a wise physician, who applies soothing medicines, and he comforts them, and says, why be afraid? Why shudder? For does he punish a person that is doing well? Or is he terrible to a person who lives in the practice of virtue? Wherefore also he proceeds, \"Will you then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and you shall have praise of the same.\" You see how he has made him friends (\u1fa5 \u03ba\u03b5\u1f77\u03c9\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd]) with the ruler, by showing that he even praises him from his throne. You see how he has made wrath unmeaning.",
