    "quote": "Here again he does not say that you are \"a guide of the blind,\" but \"you are confident,\" so you boast, he says. So great was the unreasonableness of the Jews. Wherefore he also repeats nearly the very words, which they used in their boastings. See for instance what they say in the Gospels. \"You were altogether (\u1f45 \u03bb\u03bf\u03c2] 4 manuscripts \u1f45 \u03bb\u03c9\u03c2) born in sin, and do you teach us?\" [John 9:34] And all men they utterly looked down upon, to convince them of which, Paul keeps extolling them and lowering the others, that so he may get more hold on them, and make his accusation the weightier. Wherefore he goes on adding the like things, and making more of them by different ways of relating them.",
