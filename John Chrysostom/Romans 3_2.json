    "quote": "Do you see that, as I said above, it is not their well doings, but the benefits of God, that he everywhere counts up? And what is the word \u1f10 \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u1f7b\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd]? (they were trusted.) It means, that they had the Law put into their hands because He held them  to be of so much account that He entrusted to them oracles which came down from above. I know indeed that some take the \"entrusted\" not of the Jews, but of the oracles, as much as to say, the Law was believed in. But the context does not admit of this being held good. For in the first place he is saying this with a view to accuse them, and to show that, though in the enjoyment of many a blessing from above, they yet showed great ingratitude. Then, the context also makes this clear. For he goes on to say, \"For what if some did not believe?\" If they did not believe, how do some say, the oracles were believed in?  What does he mean then? Why that God entrusted the same to them, and not that they trusted to the oracles:  how else will the context make sense? For he farther goes on to say [Romans 3:3]",
