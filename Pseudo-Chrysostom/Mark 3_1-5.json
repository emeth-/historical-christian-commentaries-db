{"quote":"(Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc. v. Chrys. Hom. in Matt. 40) He placed him in the midst, that they might be frightened at the sight, and on seeing him compassionate him, and lay aside their malice.\n\n(Vict. Ant. e Cat, in Marc.) For they knew that He would certainly cure him. It goes on: And looking round about upon them with anger. His looking round upon them in anger, and being saddened at the blindness of their hearts, is fitting for His humanity, which He deigned to take upon Himself for us. He connects the working of the miracle with a word, which proves that the man is cured by His voice alone. It follows therefore, And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored. Answering by all these things for His disciples, and at the same time shewing that His life is above the law.","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas"},{"url":"https:\/\/ccel.org\/ccel\/aquinas\/catena2\/catena2.i.html","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas"}]}
