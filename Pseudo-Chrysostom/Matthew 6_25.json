The Lord also confirms our hope, and descending first from the greater to the less, says, Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?\n\nFor had He not willed that that which was should be preserved, He had not created it; but what He so created that it should be preserved by food, it is necessary that He give it food, as long as He would have it to be preserved.",
