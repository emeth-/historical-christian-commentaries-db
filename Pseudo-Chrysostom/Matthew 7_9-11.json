    "quote": "Lest perchance any one considering how great is the difference between God and man, and weighing his own sins should despair of obtaining, and so never take in hand to ask; therefore He proposes a comparison of the relation between father and son; that should we despair because of our sins, we may hope because of God's fatherly goodness.\n\nAnd what are the things that we ought to ask, he shews under the likeness of a loaf, and a fish. The loaf is the word concerning the knowledge of God the Father. The stone is all falsehood that has a stumbling-block of offence to the soul.\n\nBecause in comparison of God who is preeminently good, all men seem to be evil, as all light shews dark when compared with the sun.\n\nHe says good things, because God does not give all things to them that ask Him, but only good things.",
