{"quote":"Also whosoever has his conscience polluted with the defilement of any sin, has a daughter sorely vexed by a d\u00e6mon. Also whosoever has defiled any good that he has done by the plague of sin, has a daughter tossed by the furies of an unclean spirit, and has need to fly to prayers and tears, and to seek the intercessions and aids of the saints.\n\nMystically; Having in the daughter of this Chauan\u00e6an prefigured the salvation of the Gentiles, He came into Jud\u00e6a; because, when the fulness of the Gentiles shall have entered in, then shall all Israel be saved. (Rom. 11:25.)\n\nThus raising his hearers to meditate on heavenly things. He sat down there to shew that rest is not to be sought but in heavenly things. And as He sits on the mountain, that is, in the heavenly height, there come unto Him multitudes of the faithful, drawing near to Him with devoted mind, and bringing to Him the dumb, and the blind, & c. and cast them down at Jesus' feet; because they that confess their sins are brought to be healed by Him alone. These He so heals, that the multitudes marvel and magnify the God of Israel; because the faithful when they see those that have been spiritually sick richly endued with all manner of works of virtuousness, sing praise to God.","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas"},{"url":"https:\/\/ccel.org\/ccel\/aquinas\/catena1\/catena1.i.html","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas"}]}
