{"quote":"In this verse is contained person, place, time, and office. Time, in the word Then.\n\nThe Persons are described in the words, came Jesus to John; that is, God to man, the Lord to His servant, the King to His soldier, the Light to the lamp. The Place, from Galilee to Jordan. Galilee means 'transmigration.' Whoso then will be baptized, must pass from vice to virtue, and humble himself in coming to baptism, for Jordan means 'descent.'\n\nThe office to be performed; that He might be baptized of him; not baptism to the remission of sins, but to leave the water sanctified for those after to be baptized.\n\nOr thus; It becometh us to fulfil all righteousness, that is, to give an example of perfect justification in baptism, without which the gate of the kingdom of heaven is not opened. Hence let the proud take an example of humility, and not scorn to be baptized by My humble members when they see Me baptized by John My servant. That is true humility which obedience accompanies; as it continues, then he suffered Him, that is, at last consented to baptize Him.","sources":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.ecatholic2000.com\/catena\/untitled-111.shtml","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas"},{"url":"https:\/\/ccel.org\/ccel\/aquinas\/catena1\/catena1.i.html","title":"Catena Aurea by Aquinas"}]}
