    "quote": "The Evangelist mentions the time of winter, to shew that it was near His passion. He suffered in the following spring; for which reason He took up His abode at Jerusalem.\n\nBe thou also careful, in the winter time, i. e. while yet in this stormy wicked world, to celebrate the dedication of thy spiritual temple, by ever renewing thyself, ever rising upward in heart. Then will Jesus be present with thee in Solomon's porch, and give thee safety under His covering. (\u03c4\u1fc7 \u03c3\u03ba\u03ad\u03c0\u1fc3 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6) But in another life no man will be able to dedicate Himself.\n\nAfter He had said, Ye are not of My sheep, He exhorts them to become such: My sheep hear My voice.\n\nBut how then did Judas perish? Because he did not continue to the end. Christ speaks of them who persevere. If any sheep is separated from the flock, and wanders from the Shepherd, it incurs danger immediately.",
