    "quote": "As if they said, What is this word by which he commands, Go out, and he went out?\n\nWe must know also that many now have devils, namely, such as fulfil the desires of devils, as the furious have the d\u00e6mon of anger; and so of the rest. But the Lord came into the synagogue when the thoughts of the man were collected, and then says to the d\u00e6mon that dwelt there, Hold thy peace, and immediately throwing him into the middle he departs out of him. For it becomes not a man always to be angry, (that is, like the brutes,) nor always to be without anger, (for that is want of feeling,) but he must take the middle path, and have anger against what is evil; and so the man is thrown into the midst when the unclean spirit departs from him.",
