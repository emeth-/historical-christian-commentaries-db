    "quote": "For David, when flying from the face of Saul, went to the Chief Priest, and ate the shew-bread, and took away the sword of Goliath, which things had been offered to the Lord. (1 Sam. 21.) But a question has been raised how the Evangelist called Abiathar at this time High Priest, when the Book of Kings calls him Abimelech.\n\nOr else, because when they hare rest from their passions, then are they made doctors to lead others to virtue, plucking away from them earthly things.",
